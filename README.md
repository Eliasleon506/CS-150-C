This project hopes to provide an interactive dashboard that visualizes the relationship between household income, house prices, and food costs over time. The goal is to help users understand how these basic needs have changed over time .

## Region of Focus: United States

The data focuses on the United States, as the dashboard aims to explore the cost of living for US residents, including trends in household income, housing prices, and food costs. This is relevant for anyone interested in understanding the economic landscape over recent decades.

## Datasets and Why They Were Chosen

This project uses datasets that represent the basic needs of life in the US. These include:

1. **Median Household Income**: Represents the average income of households over the years, sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) website.
2. **Median House Sales Price**: Tracks the average sales price of houses in the United States over time, also sourced from FRED.
3. **Food Prices**: Includes data on the cost of basic food items like eggs, milk, rice, and bread. These help to calculate typical meal costs and estimate household food expenditure.

This data is then taken and combined into a single table and the average data for each year is combined so that there is no monthly data. 
- **key columns**:
    - year
    - bacon_perPound
